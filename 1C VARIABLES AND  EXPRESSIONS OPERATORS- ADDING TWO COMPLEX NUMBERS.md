9# Experiment No: 1c-Varibles and Expressions, Operators

## AIM
Write a python program to perform bitwise and or on the given integer values.

## ALGORITHM
1. Begin the program.
2. Use the `eval()` function to get two complex numbers as input from the user.
3. Print the complex numbers entered by the user.
4. Perform the addition of the two complex numbers using the `+` operator.
5. Print the sum of the two complex numbers.
6. Terminate the program.

## PROGRAM
```python
# Read two integers from the user
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())

# Perform bitwise operations
bitwise_and = num1 & num2
bitwise_or = num1 | num2

# Print the results
print( bitwise_and)
print( bitwise_or)


```
